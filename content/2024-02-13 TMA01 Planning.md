# Work Undertaken Summary
- Document Logbook choices
- Setup Logbook
- Setup Timesheet + reporting

TODO look if I can get the dataview to work when published: [Support for Dataview JS Snippets · Issue #102 · jackyzha0/quartz (github.com)](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues/102)
[Using Dataview on Obsidian Publish · joschua.io](https://joschua.io/posts/2023/09/01/obsidian-publish-dataview/)

# Problems encountered and how you overcame them
Had to learn how DataView works. Especially around the complex object for the time property. Was able to get it to work using the examples provided by [Dataview (blacksmithgu.github.io)](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
[seburbandev/obsidian-dataview-cheatsheet: This cheatsheet provides a handy reference guide for writing powerful queries using the dataview plugin in Obsidian. (github.com)](https://github.com/seburbandev/obsidian-dataview-cheatsheet)

# Questions for Tutor


# Next work planned


# Raw Notes
## Log book
Talk about using obsidian as my log, and how I've set things out. With dates in the file names (find what the name of that note taking method is) and explain the reasoning:

1) Local notes
2) markdown files - very portable.
3) Easy mix of media (code, notes, emails, )
4) spellcheck
5) free for academic use
6) Easy cross linking of notes / ideas
7) good search
8) easy share with tutor [Hosting (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting)

#choice Using DataView so that as much as possible is kept within the logbook. A singular source of truth. Makes it easier to match up time spent with the activities. Easier to communicate with tutor. Less context switching.

### Obsidian template
Template includes:
Date - For easy tracking
Time - To show time on the weekly log AND in aggregate

## Communication requirement
Talk about emailing every 2 weeks. High level what did I achieve and what the next steps are.

TODO make a template.


## What is the artefact
The core artefact is the specification. Which due to IP reasons cannot be shared in its entirety.
The artefact is:
1) Samples of the redacted specification
2) The code required to create the specification
3) The code required to analyse the specifications
4) The tables/graphs to explain the analysis
5) The analysis discussion

Data requirements - talk about format. Permissions around use of data.

For each task, consider the associated risk.

Use Colour Coding. Maybe have a % system. and colour code based on that.

Amanada suggests contacting once a fortnight, with a briefing of where you are up to.

**YOU ARE MARKED ON IF YOU ARE ENGAGING WITH YOUR TUTOR**

The marks are based on the learning objectives on the websites.

Explain the coding approach, its interfaces. etc. Show a section of code to illistrate. Go to a section in the appendix with 1 example. Explain that its a single section and e.g. practicallity. And the rest can be seen here with a github.

They don't check their emails every day. They check them every couple of days.
